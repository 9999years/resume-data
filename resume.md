## Open Source

I have published packages on PyPI (Python) as [9999years][9999years-pypi] and
CTAN (LaTeX) as [turner][turner-ctan]. I have contributed code and
documentation to a variety of open source projects; pull requests include
pypa/packaging.python.org#457, pypa/sampleproject#66, gogs/gogs#5126,
russross/blackfriday#453, abiosoft/caddy-git#88, new-xkit/XKit#1653,
crdoconnor/strictyaml#55, lervag/vimtex#1358, azavea/ansible-pip#14, and
dahlbyk/posh-git#277.

## Independent projects

I have developed a number of independent software projects, including:

- [I C the Light], a distance-estimating ray marcher designed to render images
  of quaternion Julia sets.\
  Paper: becca.ooo/i-c-the-light.pdf
  <langs>Written in C</langs>

- [juliaplotter], a script to render cells or grids of arbitrary Julia sets, to
  overcome difficulties other renderers have in visualizing the many possible
  values of the constant *c* in the Julia set for a given rational function.
  <langs>Python</langs>

- [#wrap] an extension for Google Chrome to wrap Tumblr's hashtag interface to
  one line, addressing a widely-held annoyance with Tumblr's user interface.
  Three years after its publication, [#wrap] had retained 30,315 active users.
  <langs>CSS</langs>

- becca.ooo/mandelbrot, an interactive web app to explore the Mandelbrot set
  and visualize incremental values of the underlying sequence at arbitrary
  points.
  <langs>HTML 5 canvas, JavaScript</langs>

- [Twitter bots] such as <tw>gardensbot</tw>, which posts grids of plant and
  animal emoji in virtual “gardens” every other hour, and
  <tw>goodwordsbot</tw>, which generates fake but plausible English words from
  Latin and Greek roots.
  <langs>PHP</langs>

- [The Daily Report], a highly-customizable framework for generating daily
  agendas for use with receipt printers. Capable of reading and processing
  Google calendars, outputting weather forecasts, countdowns, to-dos, daily
  news, and other useful information. Currently running on a Raspberry Pi
  interfacing with a Star thermal receipt printer.
  <langs>Python</langs>

- becca.ooo/fox, a program to simulate and visualize the interactions of plant
  and animal populations in a virtual ecosystem.
  <langs>HTML 5 canvas, JavaScript</langs>

- becca.ooo/integral, an interactive web app to visualize integral
  approximations.
  <langs>HTML 5 canvas, JavaScript</langs>

# Graphic design / motion graphics

I have experience with Adobe CC suite software, and Cinema 4D
across a variety of fields --- I have created vector illustrations,
manipulated photos and videos, and created motion graphics from scratch.

A Wired article
([11 Beautiful, Psychedelic GIFs Created by a Math Whiz][bees-gifs]) linked to a
directory of GIF artists I curate, gifartists.tumblr.com.
Motion graphics reel available at becca.ooo/reel.

Portfolio available on request.

I have created and posted 3D animated GIFs daily on my blog at 9999yea.rs and
gathered more than 15,000 followers.

I shoot, develop, scan, and edit my own 35mm film. flickr.com/techb

I have spent years practicing and refining my skills at digital art
(including graphic design, 3D animation, motion graphics, and
post-processing) and calligraphy to be truly skilled artistically and
creatively.
